"Click on create" to create a new theme. This opens the creation form (see next screenshot). In this form, you have two choices: Use a Report Template already created (by default there are 6) or create a custom Theme. In the first case it is sufficient to name the theme, and select from the dropdown Report Template one of the six ready-made templates. In the second case, it is obligatory to put the tick "Custom Report" and then enter the hexadecimal color codes in the various sections. Once created and finished the theme click on save.
